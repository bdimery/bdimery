- Hi, I’m Brenan. I'm a Data Analyst at the University of South Carolina. 
- I’m interested in honing my skills as an Analyst and learning more about Developing. 
- I’m currently learning new expertise on Coursera and beginning to use Kaggle and GitHub. 
- I'm also a graduate student at the University of South Carolina, pursuing a Masters of Science in Data and Communication.

- If you're interested in reaching me, my professional email address is bdimery@sc.edu. 
- Thanks for checking out my profile (and sorry, I'm not much of an emoji guy).
